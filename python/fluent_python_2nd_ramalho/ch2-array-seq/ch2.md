# Chapter 2: An Array of Sequences

Container sequences:
    - can hold items of different types, including nested containers
    - examples: list, tuple, collections.deque

Flat sequences:
    - holds items of one simple type
    - examples: str, byte, array.array

See figure 2-1 (pg. 23) for diagram of container sequence memory storage.
