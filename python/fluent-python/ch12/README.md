# Chapter 12: Special Methods for Sequences

**protocol** - In the context of OOP, is an informal interface,
defined in documentation, not in code.

- e.g. The sequence protocol is just `__len__` and `__getitem__`
- It is a sequence because it behaves like one (**duck typing**)

The protocol for hashing is a `__hash__` and `__eq__` method
